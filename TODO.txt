INVESTIGATE FPS/QUALITY BUG

For me, on fast/fastest settings I get 1000+ fps, and the player bugs out and goes off at warp-speed. I assume that I reference deltaTime in FixedUpdate somewehere.

For someone else it happens at all quality settings.

WebGL ???

---------------------- Required / Mechanics ----------------------


Can implement pause between waves by adding a delay to all spawns in the spawning code.




WEAPON VARIETY
  short-range projectile (missile, auto-explodes)
    could be used for side and reverse guns.
  curving projectiles (angled initially but curve over time)
    (curve inward, outward, etc)
  lasers (instant, straight line, width may increase, visible for a duration and can be rotated)
    solid colored trail-renderer for the laser
  cluster missiles
    fire as a burst on a longer cooldown.
    semi-randomized path 
      spiraling, change clockwise or counterclockwise periodically
      turn rate and time before direction change are randomized
each attack can have a separate cooldown (but they all fire at once if you wait)
some level-ups will 'remove' weapons (to change the pattern)
too many bullets just gets boring, so at some point I want to switch to a smaller number of 'less controlled' weapons



ENEMY
art (look like an alien with eyes and wings or some such)


LEVEL UP BETWEEN WAVES (but not after the first 2 waves)

---------------------- Optional / Polish ----------------------


add noise to missile movements.


UI OFFET
might be wrong for some aspect ratios



add off-screen indicators for the planets if the player goes too far away


Transition animations for health bars (a 'recently changed' bar is red or white and shrinks over time)


have enemies move indirectly (spiral inwards or move in formation like space invaders: only move forward occasionally).


MOVEMENT EFFECTS
particle tail for enemy movements 


MULTIPLE SHIP MODELS
for later levels


parallax of stars (move at different speeds)
